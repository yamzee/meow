/****** meow ******/

a collection of `cat`s i wrote.

asm and c versions written by going through tutorials, so code may be similar
to others out there
rust and go done thanks to the rust book and included lang documentation.

go version is still a work in progress. just need to do arg handling.

rust version is the one i put the most effort into, you can see where my
interests lie :>

// BUILDING
just run `make`. all binaries are named differently.
asm will compile as `cat`, since that was the first one i did.
